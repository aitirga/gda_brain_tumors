## Installation

## Code style


### Basic packages


### PEP8 code convention
All the written python code should stick to the PEP8 code convention. You can find more info [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Commit messages
The commit messages should stick to the following structure:

`keyword: verb in imperative + commit message`

The most common keywords are listed below:

- `feat`: Should be used when the commit implements a new *feature*. A *feature* is defined as a new implementation that **the end user** will use.
- `chore`: If the commit is related to the inner functionality of the code (i.e. implements something the user is not intended to use directly), then the `chore` keyword should be used
- `refactor`: This keyword should be used when the commit adds no new implementation but modifies parts of the code, e.g. relocating classes, modifying or reestructuring the code, etc.
- `bugfix`: The `bugfix` keyword is used when the commit aims to fix a certain bug on the code.
- `hotfix`: If the fix is done directly into the `master` brahch, the `hotfix` keyword should be used.
- `docs`: When the commit is focused on adding/extending/improving docstrings, the `docs` keyword should be used.
- `style`: This keyword should be used on commits that just improve *how the code looks like*, e.g. making the code follow the PEP8 convention, adding extra comments, etc.

## Steps

### Step 1: Data exploration

### Step 2: Data pre-processing

### Step 3: Model and feature selection 

### Step 4: Model training

### Step 5: Model validation
